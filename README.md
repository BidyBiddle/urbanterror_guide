# Synopsis


Tutorial on the installation and the configuration of a Linux server for
[Urban Terror](http://www.urbanterror.info)

This repository holds the LaTeX sources of the tutorial.
You can view the last version of the PDF generated from these sources [here](https://github.com/Falkor/urbanterror_guide/downloads)


# Installation

The LaTeX sources of this tutorial are hosted as a Git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Falkor/urbanterror_guide)
You should therefore first clone this repository as follows:

	$> git clone git://github.com/Falkor/urbanterror_guide.git

Once cloned, simply run `make` to generate the PDF file. 
For most of the users, that's sufficient. 

# Advanced information

## Git Branching Model

The Git branching model for this repository follows the guidelines of [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). 
In particular, the central repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime: 

* `production`: the branch holding tags of the successive releases of this tutorial
* `master`: the main branch where the sources are in a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. This is the *default* branch you get when you clone the repo, and teh one on which developments will take places. 

You should therefore install [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), and probably also its associated [bash completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion). 
Also, to facilitate the tracking of remote branches, you probably wants to install [grb](https://github.com/webmat/git_remote_branch) (typically via ruby gems). 

Then, to make your local copy of the repository ready to use my git-flow workflow, you have to run the following commands once you cloned it for the first time:

      $> make setup

Note that it assumes you have installed `grb`

## Releasing mechanism

The operation consisting of releasing a new version of this repository is automated by a set of tasks within the `Makefile`. 

In this context, a version number have the following format: 

      <major>.<minor>.<patch>-b<build>
      
where:

* `<major>` corresponds to the major version number
* `<minor>` corresponds to the minor version number
* `<patch>` corresponds to the patching version number
* `<build>` states the build number _i.e._ the total number of commits within the `master` branch. 
      
Example: `1.0.0-b28`

The current version number is stored in the file `VERSION`. __/!\ NEVER MAKE ANY MANUAL CHANGES TO THIS FILE__

For more information on the version, run:

     $> make versioninfo

If a new  version number such be bumped, you simply have to run:

      $> make start_bump_{major,minor,patch}

This will start the release process for you using `git-flow`. Probably after that, the first things to do is to change within the main LaTeX document the version number and commit this change. 
Then, to make the release effective, just run: 

      $> make release

it will finish the release using `git-flow`, create the appropriate tag in the `production` branch and merge all things the way they should be. 
Also, you will have the generated PDF for the freshly released version as a file named `urt_setup_v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-b<build>.pdf`.
